# ec601-project-2

Mission statement: 
Use Leaflet API to make application for creating waypoints to send to an autonomous vehicle.

Leaflet API is very similar to Google Maps API but there are no costs for any amount of usage, and you can add figures to the map area.

User stories:
I, an autonomous vehicle user, want to choose a spot on a map and output its coordinates.

I, an autonomous vehicle user, want to choose multiple spots on a map to make the best travel path for my type of autonomous vehicle.

I, an autonomous vehicle user, want to automatically send the coordinates from this app to the microcontroller on the drone.

"Autonomous vehicle" can be replaced with drone, self-driving car, self-driving boat, etc.

MVP:
Application that uses Leaflet API to create GUI of a map, with the ability to click anywhere on the screen to get coordinates displayed and sent directly to the microcontroller.
